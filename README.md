# react-calculator

A calulator written in React as a project from the [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) front-end development curriculum.

## TODO
A large refactoring, because the code is not really clear.
I have to finish te responsive design an correct some css bugs. 
Also, the last time I tested this app I have found some little bugs with some calculus that I have to correct.
